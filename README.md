# Readme.Creator

## Description 

There is no one ideal format for a good README. However, there is a very incorrect option, and that is to either not include a README at all or to make one that is really meager. A few excellent practices are described in this handbook. You will come up with your own opinions about what makes a good README as your career progresses.

Your project's README file should include a title and a succinct explanation of what, why, and how. What drove you to do this? What inspired you to create this project? Note that the response is not "Because it was a homework assignment." What issue does it address? What did you discover? What distinguishes your project? Consider creating a heading named "Features" and putting all of your project's features under it if it has many.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

Add a table of contents if your README is lengthy to make it simple for users to access the information they want.
